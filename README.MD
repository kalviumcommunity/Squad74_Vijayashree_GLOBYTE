# Freelance Job Portal -  Platform for Modern Freelancers & Clients

High competition, making it difficult for new freelancers to land gigs.
High platform fees that cut into freelancers' earnings.
Long negotiation processes between clients and freelancers.


This Freelance Job Portal is designed to eliminate these pain points and introduce innovative, AI-powered features to make the process seamless, efficient, and fair for both parties.
